A production-grade chess engine combining neural network evaluation with classical alpha-beta search algorithms, deployed as a serverless API on AWS Lambda with architecture optimization.

## Architecture Overview

This project implements a hybrid chess engine that leverages machine learning for position evaluation while maintaining the tactical precision of classical search algorithms. The system follows a three-tier architecture:

```
Data Generation → Model Training → Inference Engine
     ↓                ↓                ↓
Stockfish Labels → ML Pipeline → Alpha-Beta Search
```

The engine uses a **hybrid evaluation approach** that blends neural network predictions (80%) with classical material and positional heuristics (20%), providing both strategic depth and tactical accuracy.

## Technical Deep Dive

### Data Generation Pipeline

The training data is generated using Stockfish integration and real game analysis for high-quality position labeling:

- **Dataset Scale**: 1,000,000+ positions from diverse game sources
- **Data Sources**: Kaggle datasets + PGN analysis from Grandmaster games
- **Feature Encoding**: 776-dimensional vectors representing board state (12 pieces × 64 squares + castling, move clocks)
- **Label Generation**: Stockfish depth-15 evaluations converted to centipawn scores
- **Game Analysis**: Includes games from Carlsen, Caruana, Nakamura, Fischer, Anand

### Machine Learning Model

The neural network architecture employs a multi-layer perceptron regressor trained on 1M+ positions:

- **Architecture**: MLP with hidden layers [512, 264, 64, 32]
- **Preprocessing**: StandardScaler for feature normalization
- **Target Transformation**: TransformedTargetRegressor for centipawn prediction
- **Training Data**: 1,000,000 positions with 80/10/10 train/test split
- **Optimization**: Early stopping, Adam solver, L2 regularization (alpha=5e-5)

```python
# ML Pipeline Architecture
pipe = Pipeline([
    ("xscaler", StandardScaler()),
    ("mlp", TransformedTargetRegressor(
        regressor=MLPRegressor(
            activation="relu",
            solver="adam",
            early_stopping=True
        ),
        transformer=StandardScaler()
    ))
])
```

### Search Engine Implementation

The core engine implements a highly optimized alpha-beta pruning algorithm with multiple enhancements:

#### Core Search Features
- **Transposition Tables**: Position caching for repeated sub-trees
- **Iterative Deepening**: Progressive depth search with aspiration windows
- **Null-Move Pruning**: Efficient pruning for non-tactical positions
- **Late Move Reductions (LMR)**: Reduced search depth for unlikely moves
- **Quiescence Search**: Tactical stability through capture-only extensions
- **Blunder Prevention**: Advanced filtering to prevent queen sacrifices and material blunders
- **Center Control**: Opening phase encouragement for strategic development

#### Move Ordering Heuristics
- **Killer Move Heuristic**: Prioritize moves that caused beta cutoffs
- **History Heuristic**: Track move success rates across positions
- **MVV-LVA Ordering**: Most Valuable Victim - Least Valuable Attacker
- **Static Exchange Evaluation (SEE)**: Prune obviously bad captures and hanging pieces
- **Tactical Blunder Filtering**: Prevent queen/rook sacrifices and material losses

#### Hybrid Evaluation Strategy
```python
# Blended evaluation: 80% neural network + 20% classical
blend = 0.8 + 0.02 * skill_level
cp = blend * neural_eval + (1.0 - blend) * material_eval

# Enhanced with blunder prevention
if material_loss < -50:  # Filter obvious blunders
    prune_move()
```

#### Blunder Prevention System
The engine includes sophisticated tactical safeguards:
- **Hanging Piece Detection**: Identify pieces moving into unprotected squares
- **Material Loss Analysis**: 1-ply lookahead to detect worst-case material loss
- **Static Exchange Evaluation**: Prune bad captures before search
- **High-Value Piece Protection**: Special handling for Queen/Rook sacrifices
- **Conservative Filtering**: Only filter moves losing >50 centipawns to preserve legitimate sacrifices

### Production Optimizations

#### Lambda-Specific Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Deferred imports reduce cold start times by ~60%
- **Memory Efficiency**: Model caching prevents repeated loading
- **ARM64 Architecture**: Native Lambda performance optimization
- **Joblib Configuration**: Multiprocessing disabled for Lambda compatibility

#### Performance Enhancements
- **Containerized Deployment**: Docker-based dependency management
- **Legacy Docker Builder**: Ensures Lambda-compatible manifest format
- **Resource Optimization**: Memory and timeout tuning for serverless constraints

## AWS Deployment Architecture

### Infrastructure Stack

```
Internet → API Gateway → Lambda (ARM64) → ECR Container
```

- **API Gateway**: RESTful endpoint management and request routing
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute with ARM64 Graviton2 processors
- **ECR (Elastic Container Registry)**: Container image storage and versioning
- **FastAPI + Mangum**: ASGI adapter for Lambda integration

### Deployment Strategy
